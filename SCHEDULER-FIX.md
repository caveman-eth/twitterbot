# Scheduler Control Fix

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**
The scheduler "Stop" button wasn't working properly, causing continuous API usage even when you thought it was stopped.

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Enhanced Stop Mechanism**
- **Fixed race conditions** in start/stop logic
- **Proper cleanup** of cron jobs when stopping
- **Better state management** to prevent ghost processes

### 2. **Added Force Stop**
- **Emergency stop button** (red button) with confirmation
- **Immediately halts** all scheduled processing
- **Guaranteed stop** even if regular stop fails

### 3. **Improved State Tracking**
- **Better logging** of scheduler state changes
- **Prevention of duplicate jobs** when restarting
- **Proper cleanup** on shutdown

## 🎛️ **New Dashboard Controls**

1. **🟢 Start/Stop Scheduler** - Normal toggle
2. **🔴 Force Stop** - Emergency halt (new!)
3. **🔄 Reset Errors** - Clear error counter

## 🚀 **Immediate Actions for Your 30% Usage Issue**

### **Step 1: Force Stop the Scheduler**
After deploying these fixes:
1. Go to your **Vercel dashboard** admin panel
2. Click the **red "Force Stop"** button
3. Confirm the action
4. Verify the status shows "Stopped"

### **Step 2: Monitor Usage**
- Your Moralis usage should stop growing immediately
- You can restart manually when needed with the regular "Start" button

### **Step 3: Optimized Settings**
The system now uses:
- ✅ **23M minimum block** (recent sales only)
- ✅ **20 results per sync** (reduced from 100)
- ✅ **5-minute intervals** (only when scheduler is running)

## 📊 **Usage Optimization**

With these fixes, your API usage should be:
- **~20 compute units per 5-minute sync** (when running)
- **0 compute units when stopped**
- **Much more predictable and controllable**

## 🔍 **Verification**

After deployment, check:
1. **Admin dashboard** shows correct scheduler status
2. **Stop/Force Stop buttons** work immediately
3. **API usage stops growing** when scheduler is stopped
4. **Logs show proper shutdown** messages

## 📝 **Deploy Instructions**

1. **Commit and push** these changes
2. **Vercel auto-deploys**
3. **Use Force Stop button** immediately
4. **Monitor your Moralis usage dashboard**

The scheduler will now be fully under your control! 🎉
